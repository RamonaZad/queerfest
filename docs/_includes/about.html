            <h1><span>50 years after the Stonewall riots, which were started by trans women of colour, we wish to celebrate and acknowledge the work, importance and involvement of QT of colour in the LGBTQ+ movement. We will do this by organising a four-day event of talks, workshops, film screenings and art exhibition. The activities aim to raise awareness about representation, intersectionality and how to move forward and build bridges in the era of identity politics and disenfranchisement.</span></h1>
